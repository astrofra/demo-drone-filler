# Drone Filler

![main shot](img/main_shot_0.png)

**Drone Filler** is a compo filler released at **EVOKE 2025** (Köln, Germany).  
It started as a rough visual mock-up for a bigger project, then turned into a quick demo just two weeks before the EVOKE's demoparty deadline.  
Blending kitbashed 3D assets, hand-animated cameras and an atmospheric drone soundtrack, it explored quick experimentation, visual hypotheses and the joy of bringing outsiders into the demoscene.
